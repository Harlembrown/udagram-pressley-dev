Udagram: Your Own Instagram on AWS

This is my 2nd Udacity Code Developer Nanodegree Project

CRITERIA I have met the required SPECIFICATIONS per the rubrics as
follows:

The project demonstrates an understanding of a good cloud git process.
Created an Elastic Beanstalk endpoint. EB endpoint is visible in the AWS
Management console. I have submitted screenshots showing eb cli & eb
init as well as npm run dev. 
Please provide feedback and how to get the Archive.zip file. 
Eventhough I have the .elasticbeanstalk folder with
the config.yml--the Archive.zip is hidden. 
I cannot locate it even after success w/eb cli & init. 
Here is my endpoint:
udagrampressleydev.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com 
Here is my GitHub url:

How do I change my EB health check status from Severe to Good.
